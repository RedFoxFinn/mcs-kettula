Personal project aiming to build Minecraft server for our household by using garrettjoecox's scriptserver minecraft server wrapper.

Scriptserver uses Node and I'm using it to create small personal service, which serves multiple minecraft servers with Express.

Homepage for the service will be built with React and served by the server on route '/'.
